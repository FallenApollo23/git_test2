# git_test2
My second Github repo! 
I just wanted more practice to really cement the ideas of using these two platforms. TheOdinProject made it seem like they were very important.
The process of creating a repository hadn't stuck in my head purely based on memory.
Hello again Odin!
Good thing no one will read these.
I really hope this pans out for me. I wish sitting on computers was not seen as a bad thing when I was younger. Otherwise I may have been able to start into something like this at a much younger age.
Sometimes I feel like I was born at least 10 years too early,.. and I didn't even get to invest in Bitcoin.
